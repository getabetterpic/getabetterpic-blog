My latest project has been learning <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>. I won't go into the story of how I decided to learn this. Suffice it to say I was looking to learn a server-side web development language, and Rails appealed to me. I like the Rails ethos of convention over configuration, and how it strives to make development straightforward if not entirely simple. I also appreciated the effort to make code beautiful. One thing I have decided is the learning curve for Rails is rather steep. I've been playing around with creating a robust invoice tracking application, specifically designed for law firms. I have a lot of the functionality completed but still need to work on the visual design piece since currently it is basically raw HTML. I will create some&nbsp;posts&nbsp;later about some of the specific challenges I ran up against and how I went about solving them.
